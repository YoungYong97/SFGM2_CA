  <p>{% trans "Galway is one of the brightest and most intriguing jewels of the West of Ireland. It marks the halfway point on the Wild Atlantic Way and is the only city on the entire 2500km route. The city is wild and bohemian, and at the same time full of culture, artistry, exceptional food and music. As well as being a popular seaside destination with long sandy beaches, Galway is also a thriving and cosmopolitan city centre. It is always a joy to explore with its wonderful cobbled streets, colourful shop facades, and its offbeat café/bar culture. Galway is also well known for its proliferation of festivals and civic events, with huge crowds gathering for the much-celebrated Galway International Arts Festival, the craic of the Galway Races, the spectacular Macnas Halloween Parade and numerous other events throughout the year. Ireland's great traditions of hospitality have their place in the city too, with turf fires and traditional music featuring in many of the city’s pubs. We look forward to welcoming you soon!" %} </p>
