#~ "The West of Ireland and in particular County Galway is one of the most "

#~ "boglands, the West has some of the richest scenic beauty and natural "
#~ "attractions in Ireland. With Galway City, a true Renaissance city as its "

#~ "the sunsets over Galway Bay to the rocky shores of the Aran Islands, and "
#~ "the enchanting locales of 'Quiet Man' country. Follow the trails of "
#~ "Connemara National Park, tour the great museums, watch craftspeople make "
